# Lockscreen-Calendar
An Xposed application to show calendar events on the lockscreen.

### Why?

* After Kitkat the lockscreen widgets were disabled and hence we cannot put calendar widget on the lockscreen.
* AOSP lockscreen for lolipop and marshmallow does not show calendar events on lockscreen either.

### Requirements

* Root
* Xposed Installer
* Android 5.0 and above (AOSP preferable)

### License
